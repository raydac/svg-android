# What is it?
It is a fork of [the SVG-Android library](https://github.com/pents90/svg-android), I have removed all extra stuff which doesn't work for parsing and rendering and adapted for maven build process (but I have removed test cases), also I a bit improved it to use for my purposes and use it in [the Pirates dice project](https://github.com/raydac/AndroidPirateDice) as a library.
